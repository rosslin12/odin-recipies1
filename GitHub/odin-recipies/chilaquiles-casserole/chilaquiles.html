        <h1>Chilaquiles Breakfast Casserole</h1>

        <pre>This chilaquiles breakfast casserole is made with layered tortilla chips, 
baked in a spiced chile sauce and cheese. Topped with fried or poached eggs,
and plenty of delicious fixings, it's very satisfying. Traditional chilaquiles
are made in a skillet, but this casserole version is a great way to serve
a large group at breakfast or a brunch.
